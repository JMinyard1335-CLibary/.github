## Welcome to Codehubs-C-Libary

Codehubs-C-Libary is a pet project to create repos containing algorithims and data structures written in the c language.
### Rules for projects:
<ol>
  <li> Work on one project at a time.</li>
  <li> Each repo will be dedicated to a different algorithm or data structure. </li>
  <li> Code should be reuseable (allows for generic typing) </li>
  <li> Each repo should have clear documentation on the implamentation of all functions. </li>
</ol>

### Current Repos:
<ol>
  <li> Lists </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Doubly Linked List </li> 
    </ul> 
</ol>

### ToDo:
Nothing planned yet just getting our feet on the ground.
