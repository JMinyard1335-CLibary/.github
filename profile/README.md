## Welcome to Codehubs-C-Libary

Codehubs-C-Libary is a pet project to gain a better understanding into the c language.\
This project is dedicated to createing data structures and algorithims in c with the following criteria:
<ol>
  <li> Code is cross system </li>
  <li> Code has proper error handleing </li>
  <li> Code is generic </li>
  <li> Code has minimum #includes </li>
  <li> Code has proper documentation </li>
</ol>

These goals should help to create code that can be resued in many projects.\
All documentation for the repos can be found as comments in the code and in the README of each repo.

### Current Repos:
These repos are sorted by catagory where each catagory contains the repos.
<ol>
  <li> Lists </li>
